# Simple Linear Regression Analysis: Impact of Age on Physical Health Scores (VPCS42)

## Introduction
This project explores the impact of age on physical health scores using simple linear regression analysis based on data from the 2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.

## Objectives
To analyze how age influences physical health scores and provide insights for health resource allocation.

## Data
The analysis is based on 14,423 observations from the 2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, focusing on variables related to age and physical health scores.

## Methods
We employed simple linear regression to assess the relationship between age and physical health scores (VPCS42).

## Key Findings
The analysis reveals a significant negative correlation between age and physical health scores, with age explaining 17% of the variance in VPCS42.

## Resources
The analysis was performed using SAS software.
