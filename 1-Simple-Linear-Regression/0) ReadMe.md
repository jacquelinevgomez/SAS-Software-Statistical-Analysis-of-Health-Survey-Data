# Exploring the Impact of Age on VPCS42 through Simple Linear Regression Analysis Using SAS

### Introduction
This simple project investigates the impact of age on physical health scores (VPCS42) using simple linear regression analysis based on data from the 2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The goal is to understand how age influences health outcomes and to provide insights for resource allocation in healthcare.

### Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between age and physical health scores.
- Identify significant patterns and trends in the data.
- Provide recommendations for targeted health initiatives based on age.

### Data
The analysis utilizes **14,423 observations** from the **2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey**.

### Methods
Simple linear regression was employed to assess the relationship between age and physical health scores (VPCS42). This model quantifies the effect of age on health outcomes and evaluates the significance of this relationship.

### Key Findings
- Age has a significant negative impact on physical health scores.
- For each additional year of age, physical health scores (VPCS42) decreases by about 0.26 points.
- The model explains approximately **17%** of the variance in VPCS42, indicating that other factors also influence health scores.
