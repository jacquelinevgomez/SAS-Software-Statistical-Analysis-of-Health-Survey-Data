# Exploring Predictors of VPCS42 through Multiple Linear Regression Analysis Using SAS

### Introduction
This project expands on the previous investigation into the impact of age on physical health scores (VPCS42) (using simple linear regression). For this project we will explore multiple predictors of VPCS42 using multiple linear regression utilizing data from the 2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The goal is to understand how various factors, including age, physical health group (phlth_grp5), mental health group (mhlth_grp5), and emergency room visits (er_vis), collectively influence physical health outcomes. This comprehensive analysis aims to provide deeper insights that can inform healthcare resource allocation and targeted health initiatives.

### Objectives
- Analyze the relationships between VPCS42 and multiple predictors, including age, physical health group, mental health group, and emergency room visits.
- Identify significant patterns and trends in the data, extending insights from the previous study.
- Provide recommendations for targeted health interventions based on the comprehensive findings.

### Data
The analysis utilizes **14,423 observations** from the **2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey**.

### Methods
Building on the simple linear regression approach, this study employs multiple linear regression to assess the relationships between the predictors and physical health scores (VPCS42). This model quantifies the effects of each predictor while evaluating their significance in explaining variations in health outcomes.

### Key Findings
- Multiple factors, including age and health status, significantly predict physical health scores (VPCS42).
- The analysis extends previous findings by identifying additional relationships that influence health outcomes.
- The model explains a substantial portion of the variance in VPCS42, highlighting the importance of considering multiple health determinants.
